Hello everybody who found this project!!! This is my first real project, so please don't expect too much from me and sorry for my english!!!

At first, I wanted to understand how many algorithms we have in our world. I didn't found any tutorial that could actually teach me most of them. I know that we have some sites like GeekForGeeks where we can learn a lot. But I wanted to see every algorithm in one reporitory. This is very simple and common idea. But I want to create an open-source archive for everyone who feels like me.
